Option one: Works best for my book archive
Tag dirs must be set to read only to prevent users from deleting them
No manually updating of dir information required

        also_untracked.md

    tag_one/
        [symlink to checksum one]
    tag_two/
        [symlink to checksum one]
    tag_three/
        [symlink to checksum two]
    tag_four/
        [symlink to checksum two]
        [symlink to checksum one]

    .taggit/
        files/
            [checksum one]
            [checksum two]
        structs [holds name, checksum, id, tags]
        config


Option two: Works best as a general purpose tagging system
Tagged files can be moved around
Allows for tagging files in subdirs
The user must run an update command for Taggit to relocate the files
requires a separate command to search for tags
